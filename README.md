<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/spring%20-%236DB33F.svg?&style=for-the-badge&logo=spring&logoColor=white"/>

A backend system for a car website. It consists of a `Vehicle API` and 2 microservices for `location` and `pricing`.

## Instructions

Check each component to see its details and instructions. Note that all three applications
should be running at once for full operation.

- [Vehicles API](vehicles-api/README.md)
- [Pricing Service](pricing-service/README.md)
- [Boogle Maps](boogle-maps/README.md)

## Dependencies

The project requires the use of Maven and Spring Boot, along with Java v11.
